> July 18, 2025  

If you're a luxury realtor, ranking high on Google can be your biggest lead machine. Here’s how to do it:

## 1. Keyword Targeting  
Focus on long-tail, buyer-intent keywords like:  
- “Luxury homes in [Your City]”  
- “Modern penthouse for sale in [Area]”  
- “Buy beachfront villa [City]”

## 2. High-Quality Visuals  
Google rewards engagement. Use stunning images and 3D tours to reduce bounce rates.

## 3. Local SEO Optimization  
- Set up Google Business Profile  
- Use location keywords in metadata and headings  
- Get listed in high-authority directories

## 4. Add Value through Blogs  
Weekly blogs on topics like market trends, buying tips, and area reviews position you as an authority.

## 5. Speed + Mobile  
Your site must load in under 2 seconds and feel fast on mobile.  
Use Next.js, lazy loading, and image optimization.

## Summary  
SEO is not a one-time task — it’s a compounding advantage. Start with your homepage, optimize listings, and build blog content consistently.
